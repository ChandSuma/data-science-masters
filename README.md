# Data Science Masters

Self-study plan to achieve zero to mastery in data science.

## Goals

* Score top 20% in [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/)
* Expert with different **data types** (text, image, audio, video)
* Expert with different **techniques**  (regression, SVM, deep learning, genetic algorithms, etc)
* Familiar with modern **tooling** (python, pandas, scikit, R, tensorflow, apache spark, etc)
* Expert with various **problems** (classification, search, clustering, prediction, recommendation, etc)

- fundamentals (able to read and implement technical papers)
- building at scale pipelines / architectures

## Study Plan Overview

* Module 0 - Highschool Math
* Module 1 - College Math I (Calculus)
* Module 2 - College Math II (Linear Algebra)
* Module 3 - College Math III (Discrete Math)
* Module 4 - College Math IV (Probability and Statistics)
* Module 5 - Computation and Algorithms
* Module 6 - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
* Module 7 - Deep Learning
* Module 8 - Data Mining and Recommenders
* Module 9 - NLP and Computer Vision
* Module 10 - Cloud Computing Architectures / Data Center Engineering

It is recommended to look ahead so long as the general trend is that of finishing earlier blocks before later blocks.

## Module 0 - Highschool math

Not everyone was lucky enough to have a good start with math growing up. The goal is to level the playing field - by the end of Block 0 you should feel like you went to a highschool with world class teachers and finished top of your math class.
