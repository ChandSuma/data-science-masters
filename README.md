### Calculus I (Single Variable Calculus)

#### Pre-requisites
"Single Variable Calculus is a first-year, first-semester course at MIT. The prerequisites are high school algebra and trigonometry. Prior experience with calculus is helpful but not essential"

Follows the infamous MIT 18.01 [Single Variable Calculus 2010](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/index.htm)

#### Supplementary Material
* [Calculus, Better Explained: A Guide To Developing Lasting Intuition](https://betterexplained.com/calculus/lesson-1)
* [Khan Academy Calculus Track](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-home)

### Discrete Mathematics I

#### Pre-requisites
"The prerequisite is 18.01 Single Variable Calculus. In particular, some familiarity with sequences and series, limits, and differentiation and integration of functions of one variable are necessary."

Follows the first half of [Mathematics for Computer Scientists 2010](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/) and [Mathematics for Computer Scientists 2015](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/)
