# Data Science Masters

Self-study plan to achieve mastery in data science.

## Goals

* Score top 20% in [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/)
* Expert with different **data types** (text, image, audio, video)
* Expert with different **techniques**  (regression, SVM, deep learning, genetic algorithms, etc)
* Familiar with modern **tooling** (python, pandas, scikit, R, tensorflow, spark, etc)
* Expert with various **problems** (classification, search, clustering, prediction, recommendation, etc)

## Study Plan Overview

* Block 0 - High school math
* Block 1 - College math
* Block 2 - Computation and Algorithms
* Block 3 - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
* Block 4 - Deep Learning and Cryptography
* Block 5 - NLP and Computer Vision


It is recommended to look ahead so long as the general trend is that of finishing earlier blocks before later blocks.

## Block 0 - Highschool Math Foundations

Build up "basic" mathematical foundations. Not everyone was lucky enough to have a good start with mathematics in school. So the goal here is to level the playing field and get your foundations as strong as those lucky kids.

By the end of block 0 you should feel like you just finished at the top of your math class at a highschool - and that you went to a highschool where the teachers were awesome.

#### Algorithms
* [MIT 6.006 - Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/index.htm)

A firm grasp of Python and a solid background in discrete mathematics are necessary prerequisites to this course. You are expected to have mastered the material presented in [6.01 Introduction to EECS I](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-01sc-introduction-to-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science-i-spring-2011/) and 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science.

If you have not taken and been successful in each of these subjects, please speak with a TA or professor before enrolling. We do allow students who have equivalent, other experience with the material described above to enroll, but with the firm understanding that mastery of this material is assumed and that course staff will not feel obligated to cover it or to help students who are struggling with it.

6.006 is a 12-unit (4-0-8) subject and serves as a Foundational Computer Science subject under the new curriculum. It is a direct prerequisite for 6.046 Design and Analysis of Algorithms, the theory header.
