## Discrete Mathematics I

#### Pre-requisites
"The prerequisite is 18.01 Single Variable Calculus. In particular, some familiarity with sequences and series, limits, and differentiation and integration of functions of one variable are necessary."

Follows the first half of [Mathematics for Computer Scientists 2010](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/) and [Mathematics for Computer Scientists 2015](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/)
